=head1 NAME

  ExtUtils::ExCxx - Switch to ANSI C++ exceptions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  require ExtUtils::ExCxx;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Switch perl's default TRYBLOCK method to a C++ try/throw style method
at run-time.  This should be completely transparent (except to
extensions that covertly invoke various low-level exception handling
routines :-).

=head1 IS C++ FASTER?

Maybe!  The C++ version doesn't save/restore the sigprocmask &
priocntl state.

  $ perl -Mblib ./bench.pl

  [ setjmp ] 20 secs (18.79 usr  2.02 sys = 20.81 cpu)
  [ cxx    ] 17 secs (17.14 usr  0.00 sys = 17.14 cpu)

=head1 PATCHES

At the moment, this extension requires patches to the perl source
code.  Hopefully, these changes will make it into the next developer
release.  Either apply stage* or the whole.patch to 5.004_56.

'make test' should be 100%!

(FYI: You don't need to built this extension to test the patch.)

=head2 ALSO

call_list has been optimized to call TRYBLOCK only once instead of
doing it for each BEGIN or END block.

Sigsetjmp_t stuff was moved out of JMPENV and all JMPENV manipulation
now goes through macros.

=head1 BUGS

sigsetjmp saves more state than a C++ try block.  sigprocmask &
priocntl stuff should be addressed.
